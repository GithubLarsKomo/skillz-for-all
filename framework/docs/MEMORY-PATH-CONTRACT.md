# Memory Path Contract

Every skill has a memory path. The repository-level contract below is the default inherited path for all existing skills; new or materially revised skills must also state a tailored `## Memory Path` section in their own `SKILL.md`. The memory path is a governed handoff, not an additional durable output owned by the producing skill.\n\n**Scope boundary:** this contract governs user-specific durable memory and communication preferences. Domain-, project- and workflow-knowledge discovered during a query follows [`KNOWLEDGE-PROMOTION-CONTRACT.md`](KNOWLEDGE-PROMOTION-CONTRACT.md) instead.

## Default inherited path

Unless a skill contains a stricter tailored `## Memory Path`, it inherits this behavior:

1. At completion, identify only confirmed, reusable, non-sensitive **user-specific** facts, constraints, preferences or interaction learnings that remain useful beyond the current run.
2. Keep current task status, open follow-ups, repository/tool snapshots, speculative hypotheses, secrets, sensitive personal data and raw connector payloads run-only. Route general domain/project/workflow knowledge through the Knowledge Promotion Contract instead of this personal-memory path.
3. Encode eligible learnings as an ephemeral `memory-candidate-handoff-v1` payload.
4. Preserve source provenance and freshness semantics.
5. Pass the handoff to `communication-memory-governance` for the actual persistence decision.
6. Never claim persistence succeeded unless the memory layer confirms it.

A tailored skill section may narrow what is eligible or add stronger provenance rules, but it may not bypass `communication-memory-governance` or weaken the privacy/freshness constraints in this contract.

## Principle

A skill may discover information worth reusing, but it must not persist that information directly as durable memory. At completion, the skill may emit an ephemeral `memory-candidate-handoff-v1` payload and pass it to `communication-memory-governance`, which alone decides whether a candidate becomes active memory, remains a candidate, is rejected, expires, or supersedes an older entry.

This prevents three failure modes:

- transient run state being mistaken for durable memory;
- volatile regulatory facts being stored as timeless truth;
- every skill inventing a separate persistence mechanism or memory file.

## Candidate classes

Use the handoff only for reusable, non-sensitive learnings in one of these classes:

- `durable-fact`: a stable fact that remains useful beyond the current run;
- `durable-constraint`: a stable constraint that should shape later work;
- `validated-pattern`: a reusable **user-specific** work/interaction pattern validated by evidence; general engineering, domain or workflow patterns belong to the Knowledge Promotion Contract;
- `communication-preference`: a stable user interaction preference.

Do not use the memory path for current task status, open follow-ups, current repository state, temporary tool results, speculative hypotheses, secrets, sensitive personal data, or raw connector payloads.

## Regulatory memory rules

Regulatory and standards-related candidates require stronger provenance:

- distinguish law/regulation, standard, guidance, organizational policy, interpretation, and project decision;
- include authoritative `sourceRefs` whenever the candidate depends on external authority;
- include `asOf` for time-dependent claims;
- include `reviewAfter` or `expiresAt` when guidance, implementation status, database content, transition rules, fees, review targets, recognized standards, or similar facts can change;
- store reusable interpretation/process learnings preferentially over snapshots of volatile facts;
- never promote a classification, clearance, approval, certification, notified-body position, or legal conclusion to durable fact unless the required authority is actually evidenced.

## Ephemeral handoff

The handoff conforms to `schemas/memory-candidate-handoff-v1.schema.json` and is run-scoped. Example:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "sourceSkill": "ivdr-device-classification",
  "asOf": "2026-08-06T20:00:00Z",
  "candidates": [
    {
      "kind": "validated-pattern",
      "statement": "For this product family, specimen type is a classification-relevant discriminator that must be fixed before applying the rule tree.",
      "scope": "project-family:example-ivd",
      "sourceRefs": ["classification-assessment:sha256:..."],
      "confidence": "high",
      "authorityClass": "interpretation",
      "observedAt": "2026-08-06T20:00:00Z",
      "reviewAfter": null,
      "expiresAt": null
    }
  ],
  "rejectedRunOnly": []
}
```

`communication-memory-governance` receives the payload and applies sensitivity, durability, confirmation, provenance, conflict, supersession, expiry, and forget rules. The producing skill must never claim persistence succeeded unless the memory system actually confirms it.

## Skill-authoring requirement

Every new or materially revised skill must include a `## Memory Path` section that states:

1. what type of learning is eligible;
2. what is explicitly run-only;
3. which provenance/freshness fields are mandatory;
4. that the candidate handoff goes to `communication-memory-governance`;
5. that persistence is not owned or assumed by the producing skill.

For skills whose work should normally produce no durable learning, the section still exists and says that the default handoff is empty unless a validated reusable learning emerges.
